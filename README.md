Basic Mobile Application
This repository contains the code for a basic mobile application developed as part 
of the final module of the Makers Bootcamp. The project was built using Kotlin and 
leverages Android Studio as the IDE. During the development, we focused on understanding 
the core concepts of Kotlin and working with the Android SDK to create small, functional mobile applications.

Project Overview
In this project, we worked on building a small quiz application to get hands-on experience with Kotlin and Android development. 
The goal was to familiarize ourselves with mobile app development, including UI design, handling user input, data management, and integrating with the Android SDK.

Key Technologies
Kotlin: Primary programming language used to build the mobile application.
Android Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building the app.
Android SDK: Tools and libraries provided by Google for Android app development.
Features
Simple user interface demonstrating basic Android components such as TextView, Button, EditText, etc.
Event handling using Kotlin to respond to user interactions.
Basic data storage and retrieval logic (if applicable to your project).
Integration with Android-specific features like Intent, Activity, and Fragments.
